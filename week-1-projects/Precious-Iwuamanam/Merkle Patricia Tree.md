# Merkle Patricia Trees in the EVM

Merkle Patricia Trees (MPTs) are a fundamental data structure in Ethereum, used to efficiently store and verify blockchain state data. They combine Merkle Trees (for cryptographic security) and Patricia Tries (for efficient key-value storage), ensuring that Ethereum’s state remains organized, secure, and tamper-proof.

## How Merkle Patricia Trees Work in the EVM

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) uses Merkle Patricia Trees to store and update blockchain data. Ethereum maintains three key MPTs, each serving a distinct purpose:

1. **State Trie:**
        Stores account information, including balances, nonce, storage root, and code hash.
        Each account's storage is itself a separate MPT (Storage Trie).
        The root hash of this trie is stored in Ethereum’s block header, enabling efficient verification of the blockchain state.

2. **Storage Trie:**
        Each Ethereum account with smart contract storage has its own Storage Trie.
        Stores key-value pairs for contract variables and mappings.
        The root hash of the Storage Trie is referenced in the State Trie.

3. **Transaction and Receipt Tries:**
        The Ethereum block header also contains MPTs for transactions and receipts within a block.
        This allows efficient verification of transactions without needing to store the entire blockchain.

Each of these tries has a unique Merkle Root Hash, which is stored in the block header and serves as a cryptographic fingerprint of the blockchain’s state.



## Role of Merkle Patricia Trees in Securing Ethereum

MPTs enhance Ethereum’s security, efficiency, and scalability in several ways:

1. **Efficient State Verification:**
        Instead of downloading the entire blockchain, nodes can verify data by checking Merkle proofs, drastically reducing computational overhead.
        Light clients (such as mobile wallets) use these proofs to validate transactions without storing full node data.

2. **Tamper Resistance:**
        Any modification in an account’s balance, contract storage, or transaction history changes the corresponding Merkle Root Hash, making unauthorized changes detectable.
        This ensures immutability and trustlessness in Ethereum’s ledger.

3. **Otimized Storage & Performance:**
        The trie structure enables fast lookups and updates, reducing data redundancy and making Ethereum more scalable.
        Deletion and modification of data are efficient, as changes only affect a small part of the trie.


## Structure and Fuctionality of Merkle Patricia Trees

Merkle Patricia Trees combine the strengths of two data structures:

**Merkle Trees:** Enable cryptographic security by hashing data at each node, ensuring that any modification changes the Merkle root.

**Patricia Tries:** Optimize storage by compressing paths in the trie, making key-value lookups, insertions, and deletions more efficient.

> MPTs use a radix-based structure where keys are stored in a compressed format, reducing unnecessary nodes. This makes them space-efficient and speeds up operations such as data retrieval, storage updates, and verification.

> These properties make MPTs essential for handling Ethereum’s rapidly changing state—instead of recalculating the entire blockchain state, only affected branches of the trie need updating. This incremental update mechanism reduces computational costs and enhances Ethereum’s scalability.

 ### Conclusion 

 Merkle Patricia Trees are essential to Ethereum’s architecture, enabling efficient state organization, cryptographic security, and fast verification of blockchain data. By leveraging MPTs, Ethereum ensures decentralization, trustless verification, and scalability, making it a powerful platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).
